# Q1. If you have any, what are your choices for increasing the comparison between different figures on the same graph?
# 

# Adjust scale.
# Use contrasting colors.
# Include data labels.
# Simplify the graph.
# Provide a clear legend.

# Q2. Can you explain the benefit of compound interest over a higher rate of interest that does not compound after reading this chapter?
# 

# compound interest offers the advantage of exponential growth, leverages the time value of money, facilitates long-term wealth accumulation, and provides passive growth. These benefits make it a compelling choice compared to a higher rate of interest that does not compound.

# Q3. What is a histogram, exactly? Name a numpy method for creating such a graph.
# 

# A histogram is a graph that shows how often different values appear in a dataset. It uses bars to represent the frequency of values within certain ranges. In NumPy, you can create a histogram using the numpy.histogram() function.

# Q4. If necessary, how do you change the aspect ratios between the X and Y axes?
# 

# In Matplotlib, use plt.gca().set_aspect() and provide a value for the aspect ratio.
# In Seaborn, use the aspect parameter in the respective plot function and provide a value for the aspect ratio.

# Q5. Compare and contrast the three types of array multiplication between two numpy arrays: dot product, outer product, and regular multiplication of two numpy arrays.
# 

# the dot product calculates the sum of element-wise products, the outer product computes all pairwise products, and regular multiplication multiplies corresponding elements. Each operation has different requirements, output shapes, and applications in numerical computations.

# Q6. Before you buy a home, which numpy function will you use to measure your monthly mortgage payment?

# To measure your monthly mortgage payment before buying a home using NumPy, you can use the numpy.pmt() function.

# Q7. Can string data be stored in numpy arrays? If so, list at least one restriction that applies to this data.

# Yes, string data can be stored in NumPy arrays.
# 
# The strings in a NumPy array must have a fixed length. This means that all the strings in the array must have the same number of characters. If a string exceeds the specified length, it will be truncated.
